How to analyze the massive amount of data a firm collects?  
How to gather deep insight from the data?  
How to find the "signal" in the noise?  The "real meaning" in the data.  

Basic big data pipeline:

Gather data -> Store data -> Analyze data -> Make predictions -> Derive insight -> Create value  

Big Data Stack: Collect -> Integrate -> Analysis -> Take action/make decisions

Big Data Stack purpose: Real-time, Scalable, High Performance computing analytics systems

Data can be divided into two realms:

1. Structured data (traditional databases, spreadsheets, etc)
2. Unstructured data (everything else. articles, images, social data, etc)


### Hadoop

Hadoop is a...

* Reliable 
* scalable 
* distributed 
* computing framework

It enables...

* distributed processing
* of large data sets (cant fit in the ram of a single computer)
* across clusters
* of commodity servers

Basic components:

1. Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS) - where the data is held (distributed across the cluster)
2. Hadoop MapReduce - the programming model
    * Moves compute logic to where the data is
    * (instead of moving data to where the compute logic is -- the traditional way)


Hadoop 2.0: MapReduce is now YARN (more flexible)


### Big Data

Don't just analyze data for the heck of it.  

* Think about the VALUE you're looking to extract.
* Think about the ROI.  
* Think about the QUESTION you want to ask of the data.
